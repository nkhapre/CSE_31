TPS 2
1. You can open a Mac terminal by clicking Launchpad then searching for "Terminal," 
or open an IDE such as Visual Studio Code and click new terminal at the top.
    a. Yes
    b. I would want more than 1 terminal open so I could run different programs at the same time.

2. The command is "ls" to list current contents of a folder.

3. From my current directory inside this CSE-31 folder I just have to type "cd ~/Desktop" to go back to my Desktop.

4. To create a new directory called "CSE-31" I would type "mkdir CSE-31" in the terminal.


TPS 3
1. 
GCC in linux terminal: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gcc-command-in-linux-with-examples/
GCC in Powershell terminal: https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-install-GCC-or-G++-on-Windows-PowerShell

3. I used gcc main.c -o main to compile my code
4. There should be an executable file called main or whatever you decide to name it created.
5. -c compiles files and creates an object file without an executable. You can then link the object files to make an executable
6. -g will include debugging information in the executable file.
7. Using #3 as an example I would change "gcc main.c -o main" to "gcc main.c -o cselab1"
8. It makes a file called a.out for Mac and a.exe for Windows as well
9. I use ./main
