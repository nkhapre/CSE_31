TPS 1
1. A cache is used to store data that we can retrieve in the future. We need it because it is faster than retreiving the actual data
4. To offset a block size of 16 you need 4 bits as we use log base 2 to the block size, but it is not practical to use 4 bits for a size of 16 as
we then need 4 bits for every 1 byte.
5. We need 6 bits for a block size of 64, and to represent it as a function is n = log2(N) bits
6. We know the total block size by multiplying the number of blocks by the block size.
7. The remaining bits are stored in the cache's tag. This is important as we can then tell the other data in the cache.
8. 
    a. 2^20 bits which is 1MB
    b. The offset bits is 3
    c. We need 16 blocks
    d. 4 bits.
    e. The number of tag bits is the offset minus the index which is 16-3 so 13 tag bits
    g. Each row of the cache comprises 13 bits for the tag, 1 bit for the 
       valid bit, 1 bit for the dirty bit, and 8*8 bits for the data block, 
       totaling 79 bits per row.

TPS 2
1. The disadvantage of a direct mapped cache is that if two blocks are in the same location and are accessed, they will be swapped when accessing
which is known as thrashing.
3. We need 8 bits from log base 2 of 1024/4
4.  
    a.The size of main memory is approximately 2^20 bytes, equivalent to 1MB.
    b. The number of bits required for the offset is determined by log 
       base 2 of 8, resulting in 3 bits.
    c. With a cache size of 128 bytes and a block size of 8 bytes, there 
       are 16 blocks.
    d.  The cache contains 8 sets, derived from dividing the number of blocks 
       by 2, resulting in 8 sets.
    e.  The number of index bits is determined by log base 2 of 8, resulting 
       in 3 bits.
    f.  Subtracting the offset and index bits from the total address bits 
       (20 bits) yields 14 bits for the tag.
    h.  Each row of the cache comprises 14 bits for the tag, 1 bit for 
       the valid bit, 1 bit for the dirty bit, and 8*8 bits for the data 
       block, totaling 80 bits per row.
