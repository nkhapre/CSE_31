Assignment 1
1. What caused the segmentation fault was in line 25, the scanf line in the while loop did not pass the input as a reference
2. You can fix this line by adding an '&' symbol in the scanf statement

3. The sum is not being updated because we are not passing the reference of sum through the function and it is not being updated
correctly 
4. In order to fix the error we just make sum a double pointer at every instance it is used and then pass it as a reference
when we call it in the function

Assignment 2
1.This output is expected
2. This output is unexpected. The bug is that the previous second string is not cleared and we need to add a terminator line
3. This output is technically expected because we set the length of the string to 10 when we declared it.
