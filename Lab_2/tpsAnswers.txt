TPS 2
1. I just use gcc punishment.c which creates an a.out file
2. I then use lldb <name of executable file>
3. I use lldb punish then type run in the command line
4. A breakpoint is the point where the code stops. You can set it by click the red dot next to the number of what line it is.
5. To run the program line by line you can use step
6. To see the variable we use print + <variable name>
7. You can use c or continue
8. We exit from LLDB with 'exit'

TPS 3
1. There are 2 pointers in the first line of main(): *px and *py
2. The values will probably be all garbage values, however for me x and arr[0] is a garbage value while y is always 0. 
I know C doesn't initialize variables to 0 to save space but I'm not sure y is still equal to 0.
3. You prevent them by initializing the values to 0.
4. I used printf and for the type to display %p with &x and &y
5. I've adjusted the code
6. I have inserted the code
7. I added the code
8. Yes this result makes sense it is the same as the address as arr[0] because arr is a pointer to the first position in arr.
