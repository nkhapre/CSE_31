TPS 1
1. Static for global variables, stack for local variables,
and heap for dynamic variables

2. 
    a. There are 3 variables declared
    b. There are 2 pointers, one of them points to an int the other points to a pointer of an int
    c. These are stored in the stack
    d. Since the address of num is being assigned to ptr it will point to the heap

TPS 2
1. This program is a linked list that makes memory for the first node, called head.
2. I have inserted the code
3. There is a couple things, one is that the struct memory is stored in order which we can see by the end of the addresses
incrementing by 4. Also head is stored separately from the rest of the node struct.
