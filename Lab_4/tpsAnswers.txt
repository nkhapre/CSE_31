TPS 1
1. I would expect it to print 2 in hex format which is also 2.
2. I would expect it to print just 0x41 + 2 because of the for loop written. 
3. It prints a string of numbers which I am assuming is 'A' + 2 in hex format.
4. Now it prints out only 2 which is a little confusing.
5. 
    a. Only 1 array is allocated for in this program, four_inits
    b. No they are not pointing to the same location.

6. The difference in addresses is 4 which means they are stored as ints
8. The difference in addresses is only 1 which means they are being stored as chars as a char only takes up 1 space.
10. C accesses memory by the type of variable it is not the increment of the for loop, if it is an int it will be 4 spaces versus a char
which is only 1 space.

TPS 2
1. Line 8 allocates memory for a 2d array on the heap dynamically, which is during the runtime of the program.
2. We can access the ith value of an array using arr[i];
4. We need to pass the size as an argument so we know how much to print when we do our for loop as the size of an array is not given 
in C
