TPS 1
1. Mars stands for "MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator"
5. 
    a. You can load an assembly file by clicking file, then open, and loading it in.
    b. You can assemble the program by clicking the wrench and screwdriver icon
    c. You can run the program in multiple ways, there is a green button to run it to completion and then also to step it through each line
    d. No you have to first click assemble for the green icon to become available
    e. You would click the green button with a 1 next to it
    f. You click the rewind button to reset the program and then hit the green button again.

TPS 2
1. .data defines the program data and you put your program in it. 
.word declares a word variable of 4 bytes in the static you would put a variable you want to use later in it with a value
.text is for the program instructions
2. Line 10 declares a function fib and states to break if $t3 and $0 are equal and move on to finish
3. Line 15 says to jump to fib which makes this a recursive function
4. First you have to assemble the program, then go to the execute tab, and check off the tab that say Bkpt
5. I would continue executing my code by stepping through it.
6. You go to registers and manually click in to edit the register
7. n is store in 0x00000000 in $t3
8. syscall are kind of like native commands that change depending on what set as the argument. In line 19 it is 1 which will print out
 an integer that is store in $a0. Line 21 the call is 10 which calls for the termination of the program.
