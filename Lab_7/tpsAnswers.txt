TPS 1
1. A function takes in input, performs tasks, and returns a value, a method procedure does not return a value and a method is a function that
belongs to a class 
4. It is Line 12 and we jump to Line 20 where SUM is written. The label SUM then adds the two numbers together and stores it in a third register
5. We could not use j instead of jr because jr is jump register and is used to return a value of a function in an address. J is just jump
and takes in an label.
6. It is supposed to be saved in line 21, in the register $v0. The value of the address is 15. This makes sense because we are adding n and m, 
which are 5 and 10 respectively.
7. There is an error 
8. The program should return to 0x00400034
9. It is not correct it is off by 12
10. The output is 15
12. If we just use jal SUM we do not need to save the register

TPS 2
1. The output should be 38
3. SUM knows where to go because of JAL which is jump and link 
5. The original value is overwritten, this is a problem because we are going to use the original value of x again
