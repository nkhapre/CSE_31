TPS 1

4. Machine instruction contains 32 bits
5. There are r-type, i-type, and j-type.
Two r-type instructions are sw and lw, two i-type instructions are divide and double, and two pseudoinstructions are 
branch less than and branch greater than
6. 
    a. Add immediate is a core instruction and has 3 fields: $s0, $zero, 25.
    b. 1,2 and it is 8 hex. Rs is $zero its value is 0, rt is $s0 and its value is 16, and the immediate is 25 its value is 0x19
    c. The machine code is 001000 00000 10000 0000 0000 0001 1001, the hex code is 20200019
7.
    a. This code in hex is 0230802A and the binary is 0000 0010 0011 0000 0100 0000 0010 1010
    b. The instruction type is R type and we can tell because there are 6 fields in the binary code. The fields are the opcode, the rs, rt, rd, shamt and
    funct
    c. The opcode is 0x00, the rs is 0x10, the rt is 0x10, the rd is 0x00, the shamt is 0x00, and the funct is 0x2A.
    d. This is the slt operation and we can tell by the funct field. The rs and rt maps to $s0 
    indicated by 10000, the rd maps to $t2 which indicated by 01010.
    e. The mips instruction is slt $t0, $s1, $s0, this is the same as the text segment.
8. 
    a. This is an I-type instruction 
    b. The opcode is 0x05, the rs is 0x08, and rt is 0x00. 
    c. The label is LESS and the address is 0x0040001c
    d. No we do not put the address of the immediate field of the instruction because it is not absolute.
    e. You first have to find the address of the bne line adn the LESS line which is 0x00400014 and 0x0040001c. Then find the difference between the addresses
    and divide by 4 to find the final answer which is 1.
    f. The binary is 000101 01000 00000 0000 0000 0000 0001 the hex is 0x15000001 which matches the code in the text section.

9. 
    a. This is a j-type instruction and there are onlu 2 fields.
    b. The opcode in hex is 0x02
    c. The label is the GREQ label and the address is 0x00400030
    d. We can use 26 bits in this section of the field. We can "squeeze" the address into the field by utilizing the fact that addresses are multiples of 4
    and the last two bits will always be 0 which means we can just drop the last two bits.
    The binary is 0000 0000 0100 0000 0000 001.
    e. The binary code is 000010 100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 00 and the hex code is 0x0810000c, which does match the text segment.
